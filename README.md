# Movie Trailer Website Project

As first project in **Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree** I wrote server-side code to store a list of **my favorite animated movies**, including a movie poster imagery and a movie trailer URL. The result is a static HTML page that allows visitors to **view the trailer** of these movies by clicking on the **movie poster**.

## Requirements
In order to run this Movie Trailer Website you should have the following programs installed:
* Python
* web browser of your choice

## Installation

Run `python entertainment_center.py`.
